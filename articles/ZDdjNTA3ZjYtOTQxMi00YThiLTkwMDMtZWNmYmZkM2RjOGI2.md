Suppose you want to see only alerts that have been reported within the last month. Here's how you do that from the alerts screen.

**1\.** Tap the **Alerts** tab at the bottom of the screen.

**2\.** Make sure you have a program selected from the programs dropdown in the top left. If it says **All Programs**, you'll need to tap it and select a program before continuing.

**3\.** You should now see a little calendar in the top left, to the left search box. It should already have a month and year under it in MM/YYYY format. This is your report date button. Go ahead and tap it.

**4\.** A list of months and years should appear. Tap any one of these and you'll be returned to the list of alerts narrowed down to the alerts within the month you selected.

One of the options will have a little checkmark next to it. This marks the report date you already have selected.

Usually another option in the list will have a little star next to it. **That marks your selected program's current report date.**

**Remember**, you'll only be able to select a report date if you have a program selected. Due to the large volume of information in GreenX, the alerts screen is designed not to filter by report date when you select "All Programs."
